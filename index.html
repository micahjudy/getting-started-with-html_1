<p> The internet works by useing its own unique language called <b><em>HTTP</em></b>. The process starts by you opening up a browser like <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> <br>the browser then sends a request to the server finds the HTML document and sends it back to the browser.<br> The browser then interprets that information and desplays in on the users screen.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML documents are what most on the web is madeup of.<br> HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> <br>It contains text that make up what you see and links to documents <br> that make up how you see it as well.</p>
<b>Tags</b>
<p>Tags are what HTML uses to distinguish how browers react to the document. <br>Example of some tages<br> Bold-b<br>Paragraph-P<br>Images-IMG<br> Tags are also  madeup of either <b>Inline</b> or<b> Block </b>.<br> Block tags have something decribed as an "Invisible Box" surrounding the contents inside the tag.</p>
<b>Computers Stupid vs Smart</b>
<p>Computers are considered to be stupid. Why are computers considered stupid? well all computers do is read and<br> interpret the documents/code it is given if a programmer makes even a small mistake it can cause<br> a major problems for the program.
